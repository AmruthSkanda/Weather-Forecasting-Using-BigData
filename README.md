# Weather-Forecasting-Using-BigData
Leveraging MapReduce on Hadoop for weather prediction helps ease distributed storage &amp; processing, scalability, etc., Machine Learning's algorithms like Linear Regression Algorithm is used for prediction. This project also implements Sliding Window algorithm in R for Weather prediction.
